    "- Speech recognition is about translating spoken languages into text. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are various real-life applications of speech recognition systems e.g. Apple SIRI which recognizes speech and translates it into text, and acts on the translated text subsequently.\n",

    "#### 1. How Does it Work\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.1 Speech input i.e. audio file or captured via microphone\n",
    "    1.2 Convert physical sounds into electrical signals\n",
    "    1.3 Convert electrical signals to digital data using analog-to-digital converter\n",
    "    1.4 Model can be built on digitized data and used to transcribed audion into text\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Hidden Markov Model (HMM), deep neural network models are used to convert the audio into text. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Full details on process is beyond the scope of this blog. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is a simple demonstration on how to convert speech to text using Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- I'll use the 'Speech Recognition' API and 'PyAudio' library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [Speech Recognition API](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) supports several API’s, here I'll be using the Google speech recognition API. \n",
