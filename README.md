# Speech Recognition using Python

In this notebook, I'll illustrate how to convert speech into text using Google speech recognition API. This especially useful for NLP projects, especially converting audio to transcripts data. Using the Google speech recognition API is an easy method to convert speech into text, but it requires an internet connection to operate.  It will also require the `Speech Recognition` API and `PyAudio` libraries.

You can install the libraries from within the Jupyter notebook:

```
!pip install SpeechRecognition
!pip install PyAudio
```

or from the command line:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade SpeechRecognition
python3 -m pip install --upgrade PyAudio
```
