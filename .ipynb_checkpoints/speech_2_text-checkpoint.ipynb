    "- There are various real-life applications of speech recognition systems e.g. Apple SIRI which recognizes speech and translates it into text, and acts on the translated text subsequently.\n",

    "- The Hidden Markov Model (HMM), deep neural network models are used to convert the audio into text. \n",
